  <h1>ðŸ’£ Methods ðŸ’£</h1>
  <h3>DNS + NTP + TCP Reflection</h3>
  In short, attackers exploit these reflection and amplification techniques to create an excessive volume of traffic directed at a specific target. This can result in overloading of target resources, causing slowness or unavailability of services, often referred to as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
  <h3>IO STRESSER</h3>
  In short, the attack itself aims to overwhelm the target with a large volume of requests in a way that causes slowness or unavailability of services.
